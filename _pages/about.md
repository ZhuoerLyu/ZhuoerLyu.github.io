Hi!

My name is Zhuoer Lyu. I am currently a PhD stduent from [SEFCOM](https://sefcom.asu.edu/) at Arizona State University, mainly advised by [Dr. Tiffany Bao](https://www.tiffanybao.com/). I also work with [Dr. Adam Doupé](https://adamdoupe.com/), [Dr. Fish Wang](https://ruoyuwang.me/) and [Dr. Yan Shoshitaishvili](https://yancomm.net). 
My research interests are focused on data-driven security, particularly the integration of program analysis with machine learning techniques to solve security problems while maintaining generality and scalability. 
Moreover, I am also interested in  exploring the development of trustworthy AI and adversarial machine learning, which have become increasingly significant in our current era of AI advancement.
